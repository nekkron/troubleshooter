Batch file to run locally gathering PC information

This batch file was created to gather as much computer information as possible with as little work from the user.
While domain-joined computers can gather remote information easier and in other ways, this was created for the many local workgroups my company operates on. 

For this script to run correctly, it needs to be placed anywhere on the local machine and is to be ran as the user experiencing the issue.
Once the script has finished running it will create a text file on the desktop and copy the same file to the running user's OneDrive.
